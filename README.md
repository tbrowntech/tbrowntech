- 👋 Hi, I’m Taylor Brown.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything programming, but right now my focus is on Python and web development.
- 🌱 I am doing a couple simple projects in Python to continue learning and developing my skills
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on anything, although security applications are of most interest to me
